- 👋 Hi, I’m @redhauser
- 👀 I’m interested in making games, art, and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C#, Lua, re-learning JS, HTML, CSS. Looking forward in the future to learn JS frameworks, SQL, Java, Bash, and to expand my knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects surrounding games! I aspire to become a game developer, and any experience to improve my skills is appreciated.
- 📫 How to reach me: As of right now, consider just commenting on my git repositories. In the future, I might share my Discord account here.
- ✨ I'm currently working on a Discord bot!
